        <p>As a Technology Fellow who went through the program I have gained extensive experience in a wide variety of modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, and Git. One of my most challenging projects was an eCommerce site I was tasked with constructing. This project required me to use HTML and CSS to layout the framework and design of the site. Furthermore, I was tasked with building an API using Javascript and Node.js to power the front-end. Lastly, I used Git to track and keep a history of the various changes that I made.</p>
